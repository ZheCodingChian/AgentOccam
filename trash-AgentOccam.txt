INSTRUCTION:
You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
REASON:
Provide your rationale for proposing the subsequent action commands here.
ACTION:
Select your action here.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable, indicate "N/A" and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [5h 47min]`
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.
- tab_focus [tab_number]: Switch to a different open tab. Tab numbers are shown in the OPEN TABS section at the top of the observation (0-indexed). E.g., `tab_focus [0]` to switch to the first tab, `tab_focus [1]` for the second tab.
- close_tab: Close the current tab and switch to another open tab. If no tabs remain, a new blank tab will be created. E.g., `close_tab`

RESPONSE:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
No interaction history yet. This is the first step.

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The current page is the EdgeProp Singapore Property News page (https://www.edgeprop.sg/property-news). There are multiple sections with "View All" links. The objective is to click the "View all button to view all news" and extract the first news headline in the newly opened tab. I see a "View All" link at ID 514 under the heading "Property News" and date "7 January 2026". That seems like the main "View All" for the latest property news. There are also other "View All" links for categories like "In Depth" (ID 618), "News" (ID 1699), "Showcase" (ID 1729), "Deal Watch" (ID 1761), "International" (ID 1791), "Personality" (ID 1821), "Mandarin" (ID 1853). The task likely refers to the main "View All" for news articles. The link at ID 514 has text "View All" and URL https://www.edgeprop.sg/property-news/latest. That appears to be the button to view all news. I should click that.

REASON:
The "View All" link at ID 514 is prominently placed under the main "Property News" heading and date, suggesting it's the primary view all button for news articles. Clicking it should open a new tab or navigate to a page listing all news. After clicking, I need to extract the first news headline in the newly opened tab.

ACTION:
click [514]

OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
514, 521, 526, 531, 536, 542, 566, 1699, 618, 1729, 1761, 1791, 1821, 1853

OBJECTIVE:
Click the View all button to view all news. Extract the first news headline in the newly opened tab.

INSTRUCTION:
You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
REASON:
Provide your rationale for proposing the subsequent action commands here.
ACTION:
Select your action here.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable, indicate "N/A" and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [5h 47min]`
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.
- tab_focus [tab_number]: Switch to a different open tab. Tab numbers are shown in the OPEN TABS section at the top of the observation (0-indexed). E.g., `tab_focus [0]` to switch to the first tab, `tab_focus [1]` for the second tab.
- close_tab: Close the current tab and switch to another open tab. If no tabs remain, a new blank tab will be created. E.g., `close_tab`

RESPONSE:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
I clicked the "View All" link at ID 514, which was under the main "Property News" heading and date "7 January 2026". The action was intended to open a new tab with all news. The observation shows that a new tab (tab 1) opened with title "Search Singapore's property news | EdgeProp.sg". However, the current tab remains the original property news page (tab 0). The objective is to extract the first news headline in the newly opened tab, so I need to switch to tab 1.

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The current observation is still showing the original property news page (tab 0). There are two open tabs: tab 0 titled "Singapore Property News - Latest, Breaking, In-Depth | EdgeProp Singapore" and tab 1 titled "Search Singapore's property news | EdgeProp.sg". The URL of tab 0 is https://www.edgeprop.sg/property-news. The page contains many sections with "View All" links, but the "View All" link at ID 514 has already been clicked. The new tab (tab 1) likely contains the list of all news articles. To extract the first news headline, I must switch to tab 1 and locate the first headline.

REASON:
The objective requires extracting the first news headline in the newly opened tab. Since the new tab is already open (tab 1), I need to switch to it and then identify the first news headline. I will use the tab_focus action to switch to tab 1.

ACTION:
tab_focus [1]

OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
514, 521, 526, 531, 536, 542, 566, 618, 1699, 1729, 1761, 1791, 1821, 1853

--------------------------------ACTOR--------------------------------
OBJECTIVE:
Click the View all button to view all news. Extract the first news headline in the newly opened tab.

INSTRUCTION:
You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
REASON:
Provide your rationale for proposing the subsequent action commands here.
ACTION:
Select your action here.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable, indicate "N/A" and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [5h 47min]`
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.
- tab_focus [tab_number]: Switch to a different open tab. Tab numbers are shown in the OPEN TABS section at the top of the observation (0-indexed). E.g., `tab_focus [0]` to switch to the first tab, `tab_focus [1]` for the second tab.
- close_tab: Close the current tab and switch to another open tab. If no tabs remain, a new blank tab will be created. E.g., `close_tab`

ONLINE INPUT:
OBJECTIVE:
Click the View all button to view all news. Extract the first news headline in the newly opened tab.
PREVIOUS PLANS:
[0] (Active Plan) Find the solution to "Click the View all button to view all news. Extract the first news headline in the newly opened tab."
INTERACTION HISTORY:
<step_0_interaction>
OBSERVATION:
The current page is the EdgeProp Singapore Property News page (https://www.edgeprop.sg/property-news). There are multiple sections with "View All" links. The objective is to click the "View all button to view all news" and extract the first news headline in the newly opened tab. I see a "View All" link at ID 514 under the heading "Property News" and date "7 January 2026". That seems like the main "View All" for the latest property news. There are also other "View All" links for categories like "In Depth" (ID 618), "News" (ID 1699), "Showcase" (ID 1729), "Deal Watch" (ID 1761), "International" (ID 1791), "Personality" (ID 1821), "Mandarin" (ID 1853). The task likely refers to the main "View All" for news articles. The link at ID 514 has text "View All" and URL https://www.edgeprop.sg/property-news/latest. That appears to be the button to view all news. I should click that.
REASON FOR ACTION:
The "View All" link at ID 514 is prominently placed under the main "Property News" heading and date, suggesting it's the primary view all button for news articles. Clicking it should open a new tab or navigate to a page listing all news. After clicking, I need to extract the first news headline in the newly opened tab.
ACTION:
click [514]

RESPONSE:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
In step 0, I clicked the "View All" link (ID 514) on the EdgeProp Singapore Property News page to view all news. In step 1, I switched to the newly opened tab (tab 1) which displays a list of latest articles. The current tab is tab 1, showing the "Latest Articles" page with many news headlines.

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The current page is the "Latest Articles" page (URL: https://www.edgeprop.sg/property-news/latest). It contains a list of news articles under the heading "Latest Articles". There is a "Sort by:" combobox (ID 6) set to "Latest First". The articles are displayed in a grid/list format. Each article appears to have two links: one with an image and a longer title ending with "- EDGEPROP SINGAPORE" (e.g., ID 558), and another link with a shorter headline (e.g., ID 581). The first article in the list is "Four-room flats in Clementi: Starting the new year with a new record-high of 1.35 million - EDGEPROP SINGAPORE" (ID 558) and its shorter headline link "Four-room flats in Clementi: Starting the new year with a new record-high of 1.35 million" (ID 581). The objective is to extract the first news headline in the newly opened tab. I need to determine which headline text is considered the "first news headline". Likely the shorter headline (ID 581) is the main headline, but I should verify. The page also shows "12841 Articles" indicating total count. The first headline appears to be ID 581.

REASON:
The objective is to extract the first news headline in the newly opened tab. I am now on the tab showing all news articles. The first article headline appears to be the link with ID 581: "Four-room flats in Clementi: Starting the new year with a new record-high of 1.35 million". I should extract this text. However, I need to ensure I capture the correct headline. I can note the headline text and then stop with the answer.

ACTION:
stop [Four-room flats in Clementi: Starting the new year with a new record-high of 1.35 million]
