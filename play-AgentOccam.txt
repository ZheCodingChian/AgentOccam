OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The current page is the "Latest Articles" page (URL: https://www.edgeprop.sg/property-news/latest). It contains a list of news articles under the heading "Latest Articles". There is a "Sort by:" combobox (ID 6) set to "Latest First". The articles are displayed in a grid/list format. Each article appears to have two links: one with an image and a longer title ending with "- EDGEPROP SINGAPORE" (e.g., ID 558), and another link with a shorter headline (e.g., ID 581). The first article in the list is "Four-room flats in Clementi: Starting the new year with a new record-high of 1.35 million - EDGEPROP SINGAPORE" (ID 558) and its shorter headline link "Four-room flats in Clementi: Starting the new year with a new record-high of 1.35 million" (ID 581). The objective is to extract the first news headline in the newly opened tab. I need to determine which headline text is considered the "first news headline". Likely the shorter headline (ID 581) is the main headline, but I should verify. The page also shows "12841 Articles" indicating total count. The first headline appears to be ID 581.

REASON:
The objective is to extract the first news headline in the newly opened tab. I am now on the tab showing all news articles. The first article headline appears to be the link with ID 581: "Four-room flats in Clementi: Starting the new year with a new record-high of 1.35 million". I should extract this text. However, I need to ensure I capture the correct headline. I can note the headline text and then stop with the answer.

ACTION:
stop [Four-room flats in Clementi: Starting the new year with a new record-high of 1.35 million]
