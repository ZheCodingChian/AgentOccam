OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The current page is the Industrial & Data Centres category page, specifically on the Data Centres tab (selected). The tablist [73641] shows two tabs: "Industrial" [73642] (selected: False) and "Data Centres" [73644] (selected: True). Under the Data Centres tab, there is a heading "All 4 listings" and four property links are visible: [78301] 38 Kim Chuan Road, [78362] 38A Kim Chuan Road, [78423] 9 Tai Seng Drive, and [78484] Telepark. Each link includes the property name, category "Data Centres", and location (e.g., "Singapore (East), Singapore"). The footer contains a "Singapore" link [75031] that can be used to navigate back to the Singapore portfolio page. The page URL includes the fragment "#tab-data-centres". All necessary property information for the Data Centres subcategory is displayed.

REASON:
We have successfully extracted property information for all other categories and subcategories. The final step is to extract the Data Centres properties to complete the Singapore portfolio information. After noting these four properties, we will have gathered all categories and property information. Since we are at the final step of the 20-step budget, we should note the Data Centres properties and then compile all extracted data into a final answer using the stop action.
