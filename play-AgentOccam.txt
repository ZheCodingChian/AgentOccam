Note 0. STEP 2: First news headline after clicking load more: "Tender for historic Moulmein Road site awarded to Dempsey Hill developer"

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The current page is the Housing section (property index) with URL https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing?ref=top-navbar. After clicking "Load more", new articles have loaded. The first new article after the previously visible ones is link id 5963, with heading "Tender for historic Moulmein Road site awarded to Dempsey Hill developer". This headline appears directly after the last pre-load article (id 4979). The "Load more" button (id 4998) is still present at the bottom, indicating more articles could be loaded. The page includes multiple article links (ids 4804, 4822, 4840, ..., 5963, 5965, etc.) in chronological order. The objective is to extract the first news headline after clicking load more, which is now visible.

REASON:
The objective is completed: I have navigated to the property section index page (Housing), clicked the load more button, and identified the first news headline after clicking. I should now stop and provide the extracted headline as the answer.

ACTION:
stop [Tender for historic Moulmein Road site awarded to Dempsey Hill developer]
